# DBMS

DBMS stands for DBMS Bakery Management System. DBMS is yet another boring business management system made as a university assignment that facilitates management of individual bakeries as well as of a whole bakery network in every aspect of pastry production and client interactions, starting from customer interactions to staff and sales management. The system is intended to serve as a tool for bakers, which simplifies the work of bakers by providing them with recipes, as well as a tool for managing their collaborative workflow. The system also provides an interface for customers enabling them to interact with the business outside the actual bakery.

The system is merely a backend web service, which provides a REST API, and does not provide frontend.
